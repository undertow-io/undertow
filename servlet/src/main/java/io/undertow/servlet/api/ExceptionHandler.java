 * An exception handler allows you to perform custom actions when an exception propagates out of the servlet

 * handlers to handle the error however you want. A common use for this would be to change the log format for
 * exceptions, or possibly suppress the logging for certain exceptions types.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface may also choose to suppress error page handler, and handle error page generation
 * internally by returning <code>true</code>
